# DEPLOY/23

Welcome to the repo for the landing page & platform for DEPLOY/23 — [compsigh](https://compsigh.so)'s first hackathon, and our biggest event of the semester. An interdisciplinary three-day event running from Friday November 17th – Sunday November 19th, bringing together the best minds in CS, design, and engineering to hack on a project for a weekend.
