# DEPLOY

An annual Fall hackathon run by [compsigh](https://compsigh.club), the social computer science club at the University of San Francisco for meeting cool people && building cool things

---

In the spirit of one of our club's [values](https://compsigh.club/docs/values), **Open Source**: welcome to the repo for all things DEPLOY, including the web platform, where participants register, create teams, and submit their projects!

**DEPLOY/24 — our second annual hackathon — is in active development.** For the one-pager, check out [`DEPLOY24.md`](/DEPLOY24.md). For platform code, check out [`platform/`](/platform/).

For info on DEPLOY/23 (specifically the web platform at the time), check out [`DEPLOY23-README.md`](/DEPLOY23-README.md).

Like all our events, DEPLOY is a communal effort! compsigh members are more than welcome to offer any ideas, suggestions, feedback, or help for DEPLOY over on [our Discord](https://discord.compsigh.club).
