# DEPLOY/23 Debrief & Notes for DEPLOY/24

## Platform

- entirely custom DB (nothing in Notion) that accounts for registration & inviting to a team. essentially everything is automated and we just audit if/when necessary

## Event

- dinner at opening night was nice but food at presentations would be a huge plus. even just refreshments would be good
- have Redbull lol

## Presentations / Workflow

- Make it clearer to participants the presentation workflow, order of team presentations, etc.
- Be stricter on time limits
  - Maybe a timer on the podium to help teams time themselves
- Make the time blocks for presenting → judges ask questions → audience asks questions clearer (e.g. 5 mins, 2 mins, 2 mins)
- Streamline the presentation handoff (walkout music)
- Use only one laptop for presentations
  - Teams can either record their demos or if available live, we can pull it up on our end

## Promotion

- massive promo campaign
  - particularly with design & engineering
- several promo bits encouraging ppl with minimal experience to attend — that's the whole point, to *get* experience
- double down on staging as an opportunity to build skills for the hackathon
- one-month extended hackathons but more like just demos & snacks (build night on steroids)

### Judging

- external factors — like referrals or event attendance — should not impact score. use solely judge evals OR make the point formula known (for example that # of majors are considered if we do that)
- still have some sort of incentive for referrals, as well as early registration (which is much more attainable for everyone than referrals anyway)
- less weight on presentation, more on quality of project
