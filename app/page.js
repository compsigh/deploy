          <h2>Submissions</h2>
          <p>Only one team member will be required to submit the project on behalf of the team.</p>
          <p>Project submissions are not limited to a theme, and the mediums are open-ended. We suggest one of the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mobile app</li>
            <li>Web app</li>
            <li>Website</li>
            <li>Open source contribution</li>
            <li>Design system</li>
            <li>Hardware/robotics</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please do not start working on your project (coding/designing/building, but ideas are great) until after the Opening Keynote on Friday.</p>
          <p>For any submission, <strong>before you present your project</strong>, please ensure it is open-source or otherwise publicly accessible. You&apos;re welcome to keep it private until project submissions close.</p>
          <p>Submissions don&apos;t have to be complete. In that case, what would be interesting to hear is what worked, what didn&apos;t, and how you would continue to develop the project.</p>

            <p><em>Challenge yourself: in 72 hours, I learned more about React & Next.js than I did in the 3 months prior. Don&apos;t be scared to pick a stack you&apos;re not familiar with. You&apos;ll learn more than you think.</em></p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><em>Go in with a plan to learn, and have fun. It&apos;s a good place to network, meet new people, and explore different opportunities as well.</em></p>
