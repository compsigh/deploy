### Extra credit

Last year, we took the Phil position re: extra credit: the incentive for coming to the hackathon should be the experience, not point scrubbing in classes.

For this year, John from E&I gave an interesting counter to that: yes, people should be in it for reasons non-transactional, *but* at the end of the day, we all have things to do.

Suppose a student has an upcoming midterm, a project due, etc. They're most excited about DEPLOY/24, but with no *guaranteed* exchange for their time, they might not be so inclined to attend. The idea is that extra credit would bump it up on their list at least a bit.

At minimum, we can ask professors if they'd be willing to provide students who attend extra credit. After the event, we will provide participating professors with a list of students who attend *on presentation day*, as a fair middle ground.

## Prizes

The general consensus ‚Äî both on leadership and our sponsors ‚Äî is that our prizes for last year's winners were a bit...generous:

```plaintext
1st Place    >> $100
                Semester access to club AI resources
                Discord Nitro
                Recognition on compsigh platforms
2nd Place    >> $50
                Discord Nitro
                Recognition on compsigh platforms
3rd Place    >> $25
                Recognition on compsigh platforms
PPL'S CHOICE >> Cat-shaped pillow üê±
```

We agreed during our [DEPLOY/23 debrief](https://www.notion.so/compsigh/DEPLOY-23-Debrief-Notes-for-DEPLOY-24-41fc140f771f4e84aadd7a8b743edccd) that the top-three format + people's choice is a good one. The big coefficient here is that these prizes are per winning team *member*. So, for first place, it's not $200 from us, it's $800.

Some ideas for this year's prizes:

- John from E&I has generously offered $500 in microgrants for the first place team. This helps incentivize DEPLOY/24 projects to live on past the event.
- In general, cash prizes are hard because there is a lot of bureaucracy around getting those reimbursed. We can take the L out of our budget if it would make a big incentive difference.
- We can scrap Discord Nitro.
- Something physical?
- Trophies in the shape of the event logo would be dope.

## Sponsors

In total, DEPLOY/23 cost us $2,066.21, with 52 participants registered. Of course, the situation with prizes and catering likely differ, but scaling that up to 80+, we will need some help.

A checkbox (`[x]`) means the sponsor has agreed to help fund the event. Partially checked (`[/]`) means they've been asked and we haven't heard back. Crossed (`[-]`) means they are unable to support the event. Not checked (`[ ]`) means we haven't asked.

Idea from Edward and Gursh: if we do beginner/advanced categories type shit we should use different criteria for evaluation
