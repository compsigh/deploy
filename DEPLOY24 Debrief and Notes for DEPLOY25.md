# DEPLOY/24 Debrief & Notes for DEPLOY/25

## Venue

- The event being in the Hive was an awesome decision

## Judges

- 6 was a good amount
- Need to reach out a lot sooner

## Prizes

- Could be more compelling

## Trophy

- Need to order build a lot sooner
- Ended up being sick anyway <3

## Sponsors

- Were clutch asf

## Point system & rubric

- 1st, 2nd, 3rd, People's Choice good
- Not emphasizing completeness good
- Emphasis on presentation & creativity good
- Too much emphasis on problem-solving; doesn't allow for satirical projects
  - The "vibes" criterion should be the entire score
- Not emphasizing innovation: mixed results; projects were of good quality but could use more variety
- We're overthinking the whole weighting/category thing
  - Judges factor in mentally that it's a first-year team, shouldn't skew beyond that
  - We should let judges do their own curving
  - We should have some sort of mechanism that lets judges revisit each of their evaluations, and/or view all of them at once

## Trailer

- Need to start working on it a lot sooner
- 3.5 mins way too long

## Food

- Food went well — Pineapple King Bakery + Toast & Egg both amazing
  - No more from Bon Appétit though

## Promo & outreach

- Promo & outreach was a huge success: going into the classrooms made a tangible difference, especially for people who'd never heard of compsigh previously
- Echoing Chris & Jocelyn's sentiments, we need to just keep blasting people with reminder emails, Campuswire posts, Instagram, Discord, etc.
- More emphasis on staging as an opportunity to meet other solos and form teams, as well as learn more about hackathons
- Actually have merch

## Agenda

- In general, good job on schedule
- Start opening keynote and dinner sooner
- Start *working on* opening keynote sooner lol
- Remove registration and team formation deadlines
- More emphasis on office hours on day two as an opportunity to come together, socialize, take a break, and get help / help each other out

## Ground team

- More dedicated leadership people doing stuff: Edward was devving, Gursh was taking photos, Quinn was watching food and doing setup, Jet was participating lol
- Someone on video

## Presentations

- Teams were more representative of the department — way more freshman/sophomore teams :)
- Remove "all on stage during presentation" requirement (prize would just be split between those presenting)
- Actually playing the walk-out song lol
- Discord screen share worked a lot better than expected

## Web platform

- Team formation UI needs to go up early
- Some sort of "team queue" for solos
